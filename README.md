# taybrynn-portfolio

This is a no frills basic photography portfolio landing page. The website is not completed but is intended to give a basic look at some of the photography of Taylor Bryn. There are two slide shows showing the work from a BFA showcase and some personal works under the slide show "Other works". The hover over color doesn't appear in the mobile or tablet version to provide the best viewing expierence. The form is not functional (is not being sent to a server) but will check to make sure basic name and contact information are there. Thank you and I'll list feautures below.
